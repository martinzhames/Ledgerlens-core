"""Feature mutability manifest for counterfactual explanation generation.

`detection.counterfactual_engine` must never propose a counterfactual that
asks a wallet operator to do something physically impossible (e.g. make an
account younger, or undo a cross-chain bridge transfer that already
happened) or to move a feature in a direction that would *increase*
suspicion. This module is the single source of truth for what each feature
is allowed to do during search.

Almost every mutable feature in this codebase is constructed so that
*higher values are more suspicious* (the model learns a positive
association with the wash-trading label), so almost every mutable
feature's constrained direction is "decrease". `direction="increase"` is
fully supported for the one feature where the opposite holds
(`cross_chain_time_lag_median_h`).
