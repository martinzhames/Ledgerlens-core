- **#147** API endpoints `POST /scores/{wallet}/commit` and `POST /scores/verify-threshold` for ZK threshold proofs.
- **#150** Full governance proposal engine (`detection/governance.py`): `GovernanceEngine` with `submit_proposal`, `cast_vote`, `tally_proposal`, `close_proposal`, `execute_proposal`, `close_expired`; `SettingsReloader` with compile-time allowlist and atomic `.env` write.
- **#150** SQLite migration 13: `governance_proposals`, `governance_votes`, `governance_committee` tables.
- **#150** Governance REST endpoints: `POST/GET /governance/proposals`, `GET /governance/proposals/{id}`, `POST /governance/proposals/{id}/vote`, `POST /governance/proposals/{id}/execute` (admin-key gated).
- **#150** `cli.py governance-close-expired` command.
- `docs/governance_protocol.md` updated to reflect full implemented lifecycle.

### Added
