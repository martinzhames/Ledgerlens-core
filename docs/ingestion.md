# Ingestion

## Horizon cursor checkpointing

The live Horizon trade consumer persists the last successfully processed
`paging_token` to `CURSOR_CHECKPOINT_PATH` (default
`./data/horizon_cursor.json`). On restart it resumes from that token; when no
valid checkpoint exists it uses `HORIZON_DEFAULT_CURSOR` (default `now`).

Checkpoint writes occur after `CURSOR_FLUSH_EVENTS` processed events (default
100) or `CURSOR_FLUSH_SECONDS` elapsed seconds (default 10), whichever happens
first. A final checkpoint is written on a clean stream exit. The writer creates
a sibling temporary file with mode `0600`, then atomically replaces the live
JSON file. A sidecar advisory lock serializes readers and writers on POSIX.

The checkpoint contains only the paging token, recording time, and optional
ledger sequence. It contains no account, wallet, or API credentials.

### Failure and recovery

- Missing, empty, unreadable, malformed, or invalid-token files are logged and
  treated as absent. Streaming starts from `HORIZON_DEFAULT_CURSOR`.
- A checkpoint with permissions wider than `0600` produces a warning.
- A failed temporary write or replacement leaves the prior checkpoint intact;
  ingestion continues and retries at the next flush.
- If Horizon returns HTTP 404 or 410 for a saved position, the streamer deletes
  the unusable checkpoint and reconnects with `cursor=now`.
- `CURSOR_CHECKPOINT_PATH` must resolve inside `DATA_DIR`, preventing an
  environment-provided path from escaping the runtime data directory.
- Run `python cli.py stream --reset-cursor` to intentionally delete the saved
  position before startup.

The durability window is bounded by the flush policy. A hard crash can replay
at most the events processed since the latest checkpoint; it does not skip
events after the durable token.

## Flow control and backpressure

The async Horizon consumer places parsed trades in a `BoundedTradeQueue`.
`STREAMER_QUEUE_MAXSIZE` (default `1000`) is a hard memory bound. When queue
usage reaches `STREAMER_HIGH_WATER_RATIO` (default `0.8`), the producer sleeps
with exponential backoff from 50 ms up to a two-second cap before enqueueing.
Queue depth, peak depth, throttling time, and aggregate drop counts are exposed
through `HorizonStreamer.metrics_snapshot()`; snapshots never contain trade or
wallet data.

Select the overflow policy with `STREAMER_OVERFLOW_STRATEGY` or the CLI
`--overflow-strategy` option:

| Strategy | Behavior | Use when |
|---|---|---|
| `block` | Wait for queue capacity; no event loss | Completeness is mandatory and SSE disconnect risk is acceptable |
| `drop_newest` | Discard the incoming trade when full | Existing queued work should finish in order and gaps can be backfilled |
| `drop_oldest` | Discard the oldest queued trade and retain the newest | Low-latency, real-time scoring values recency over completeness |

`drop_oldest` is the default. A hostile or noisy stream can use it to evict
older high-value events, so high-security deployments should prefer `block`
and use durable cursor checkpoints to recover after reconnects. Both drop
strategies require historical gap backfill when complete coverage is needed.
Changing a queue's strategy after construction is intentionally unsupported.

Dropped-event warnings are rate-limited to every 100 events. Operators should
alert on non-zero drop counts and sustained high-water-mark hits.

## Parallel historical loading

`python cli.py historical-load` divides an inclusive-start, exclusive-end time
range into independent chunks and fetches them concurrently through the shared
retrying Horizon client. Each response is validated into the canonical
Pydantic `Trade` model before a page-sized SQLite batch is written with
`INSERT OR IGNORE`.

Chunk completion is stored atomically in `HISTORICAL_PROGRESS_PATH` (default
`./data/historical_progress.json`). With `--resume`, completed chunks make no
HTTP requests; failed and interrupted chunks are retried. The progress path
must remain inside `DATA_DIR`.

Defaults are controlled by `HISTORICAL_LOADER_CONCURRENCY=4`,
`HISTORICAL_CHUNK_HOURS=6.0`, and
`HISTORICAL_MAX_LOOKBACK_DAYS=365`. Larger concurrency improves throughput
until Horizon's per-IP rate limit is reached. Start conservatively, monitor
429 responses, and reduce concurrency when retries dominate. Smaller chunks
improve load balancing and restart granularity but increase progress metadata
and initial request overhead.
