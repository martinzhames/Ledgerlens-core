## Shell Completion

### Installation

Add the following to your shell's configuration file:

**Bash** (`~/.bashrc`):
```bash
eval "$(ledgerlens completion --shell bash)"
```

**Zsh** (`~/.zshrc`):
```zsh
eval "$(ledgerlens completion --shell zsh)"
```

**Fish** (`~/.config/fish/config.fish`):
```fish
ledgerlens completion --shell fish | source
```

### What's Completed

- Subcommand names (e.g. `score`, `stream`, `report`, `completion`)
- Common flags (e.g. `--output`, `--concurrency`, `--date`)
- `--shell` enum values (`bash`, `zsh`, `fish`)

`stream --reset-cursor` deletes the durable Horizon paging-token checkpoint
before connecting. The checkpoint location is configured with
`CURSOR_CHECKPOINT_PATH` and must be inside `DATA_DIR`.
